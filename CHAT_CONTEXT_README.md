# Chatbot Conversation Context Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Your chatbot now maintains conversation context just like ChatGPT! Here's what has been implemented:

### 🔧 Changes Made:

#### 1. **Frontend Updates**
- **ChatBox.jsx** & **ChatBoxImproved.jsx**:
  - Added session-based conversation storage using `sessionStorage`
  - Modified API requests to include entire conversation history
  - Added timestamps to messages for better tracking
  - Implemented context management (limits to last 20 messages)

#### 2. **Backend Updates**
- **API Route (`/api/chat/route.js`)**:
  - Now accepts `conversationHistory` and `sessionId` parameters
  - Maintains conversation sessions in memory (global.chatSessions)
  - Includes conversation history in Perplexity API calls
  - Stores both user and AI responses in session

#### 3. **Context Management**
- **Token Limit Management**: Limits context to last 10 exchanges for API calls
- **Session Persistence**: Conversations persist across page refreshes
- **Memory Management**: Limits sessions to 50 messages to prevent memory issues

### 🎯 Key Features:

✅ **Conversation Memory**: AI remembers previous messages in the conversation
✅ **Session Persistence**: Conversations survive page refreshes
✅ **Context Awareness**: AI responses consider the full conversation context
✅ **Token Optimization**: Smart context limiting to avoid API limits
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of context-related errors

### 🧪 How to Test:

1. **Start a conversation** with your chatbot
2. **Ask follow-up questions** - the AI should remember previous context
3. **Refresh the page** - your conversation should still be there
4. **Continue the conversation** - context should be maintained

### 📝 Example Conversation Flow:

```
User: "What are the symptoms of flu?"
AI: "Common flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat..."

User: "How long do they usually last?"
AI: "Flu symptoms typically last 5-7 days, with fever usually..."

User: "What's the difference from a cold?"
AI: "Unlike colds which develop gradually, flu symptoms appear suddenly..."
```

The AI will now remember that you're asking about flu symptoms and provide contextually relevant responses!

### 🔄 Next Steps (Optional):

If you want to further enhance the system, consider:
- Database storage for conversation persistence across browser sessions
- Conversation summarization for very long conversations
- User authentication for personalized conversation history

Your chatbot now has full conversation context capabilities! 🎉
